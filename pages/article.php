			<b>It was a good time to be a gamer.</b><br/><br/>
			Last month, over 1300 video game enthusiasts packed the halls of UC San Diego's Price Center Ballrooms to 
			celebrate the ninth annual Winter Gamefest, one of the largest collegiate gaming conventions in the Nation and one of UCSD's 
			fastest growing student events. Held during the three-day Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend, Winter Gamefest offers its festival 
			goers over $10,000 in prizes and giveaways, professionally streamed and shoutcasted tournament games, and, most importantly, a chance to pick up a controller and put away the stress of classes and midterms.

As a premier collegiate event, organized by gamers for gamers, 
Winter Gamefest caters to the largest and most popular video 
games, ranging from the electronic sports superstar League of Legends to San Diego's favorite fighting franchise:
Super Smash Brothers: Melee. Alongside other fan favorites like Starcraft II, Dota 2, Halo 4, Call of Duty: Ghosts, and more, Winter Gamefest's vast tournament repertoire gives a chance for hardcore collegiate gamers to take home a piece of the $5,000 prize pool and a chance for amateur and casual players to experience a high level of competition and production quality in a friendly campus environment. This year, Winter Gamefest also featured a Q&A panel from Riot Games, the massively-growing company behind League of Legends.

Each year, Winter Gamefest gathers the attention of sponsors from around the San Diego area, and abroad, who support the 
event through donations, sponsor booths, and giveaways, and more. This year, Winter Gamefest's biggest sponsor booth 
featured the emerging collegiate gaming powerhouse TeSPA, or The eSports Association, who, alongside Riot Games,
showed their love for the collegiate gaming scene with hundreds of dollars in exclusive Blizzard giveaways in addition to 
a TeSPA-sponsored Hearthstone tournament. Local representatives from GamerCon, ASUS, Sony, Kingston HyperX, and Monster Energy
also set up booths and giveaways for the crowds of gamers and spectators prowling the ballrooms.

Just one week after the conclusion of this year's Winter Gamefest, UCSD's Sixth College Technology 
Committee is already meeting up to begin discussing the logistics of next year's event. Each year, 
this small, but efficient gathering of student gamers, numbering no more than 20-30 students each year, volunteers 
their Monday evenings to make sure all of the little details that make a multi-thousand dollars event like Winter Gamefest possible, 
including printing and handing out thousands of flyers and posters, sending out hundreds of emails to sponsors, drafting rules and brackets
for all of the main stage tournaments, and setting up networking and power to over 200 computers and consoles.

"Without the hard work and dedication of our members, and without the support of sponsors like Riot Games and TeSPA,
our Winter Gamefest would not be possible" said Adrian Wong, director of the Sixth College Technology Committee. "In recent years, the population of videogame-playing students 
has been increasing at a pretty surprising rate. Winter Gamefest is designed to embrace and celebrate this 
emerging gaming culture by creating an exciting and welcoming event that caters to this growing population of gamers."
