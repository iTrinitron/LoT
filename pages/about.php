      I love playing mobile champions, such as Ezreal, Nidalee and Quinn, and have recently developed 
      an obsession with Homeguard mobility boots.  For the most part, games I play outside of League include:
      osu!, Minecraft, and Tetris Battle, but I enjoy trying out new games! I'm eagerly awaiting the upcoming

For a short while, I was a GM for Heroes of Newerth until I decided to go back to League of Legends.

            <div id="title">About Us</div>
            The League of Tritons was founded by <span>Christopher Zhu</span> in 2011 as a UCSD on-campus organization. 
            The club began as a group of League of Legends players hoping to form a player base at UCSD large
            enough to compete with the popular Starcraft 2 club. With the recent surge in League of Legends popularity, 
            however, players from all over campus came together to bolster the organization's ranks. From a 
            small group of about 30 members, the League of Tritons has expanded to over 700 members in the last two years.
            <br/><br/>
            The first club events initially consisted of just the officers and their friends, which totaled about 10 people. 
            Thanks to the hard work and dedication of many of the original members, including <span>Michelle Nguyen</span>, <span>Melissa Sumarli</span>, 
            <span>Michelle Lin</span>, <span>Nick Wang</span>, and <span>Benjamin Young</span>, the club now hosts wide scale intra-school and inter-collegiate events 
            that notoriously exceed UCSD room limits. As the club grew from a small gaming gathering to a large organization, 
            the League of Tritons began hosting social events like Beach Days, Karaoke Nights, and KBBQ Parties to encourage 
            the massive influx of members to bond and hang out with people that share the same passions. With the introduction 
            of the Collegiate Star League, or CSL, in 2011, we bannered around our talented League of Legends competitive players 
            as a pedestal of skill level that all members could strive to achieve.
            <br/><br/>
            Today, the League of Tritons is one of the largest and most active on-campus organizations both at UCSD and in California. 
            As a collective of gamers at heart, we strive to encourage unity between our members and within the community as a whole by
            providing a competitive, social, and positive environment for all players.
